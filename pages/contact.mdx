## This Blog

One day, I wanted a place where I could tastefully share the occasionally interesting photos and videos from my library in their original quality. I didn't like that apps like IG and Twitter were shrinking size of uploads by over 100%, making them unusable as lossless storage. As for actual storage options, Apple and Google offered additional cloud storage for a non-nominal amount per month, but the downsides of committing to an ecosystem was too great. I didn't want to be tied down to one type of phone because of storage. And so this blog was born, a place where I can keep my photos and videos in a third-party storage with a nominal monthly cost and share them directly to phones and computers over HTTP. 

Additionally, all paragraphs in this blog, including ones on this page, use Knuth and Prass's Linebreak algorithm to minimize visible whitespace, i.e. the space at the end of each line is minimized. Shout out to the JS library, [tex-linebreak](https://github.com/robertknight/tex-linebreak), for doing the heavy lifting.
