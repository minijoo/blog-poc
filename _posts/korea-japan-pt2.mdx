**Restaurant** <u>Tachibana Sushi</u>\
**Location**📍Shimbashi\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={90} />
**Notes** - Now this is my kind of sushi. In my opinion, here is the best itamae sushi I had all trip. In fact, I really dig'd it I went there twice. They have been in business at the same location for over a century. The eldest itamaesan is over 90 years old and still works behind the bar on the simpler dishes like nigiri-making. The son is the main itamaesan, a highly experienced sushi man himself, who does most of the cutting, de-shelling, frying and other types of cooking behind the bar. With one or two exceptions, the pieces and soup served in the course are without any vinegar-y or sweet embellishment and are instead prepared with flavors that the actual sea matter instrinsically embody which can be sweet and salty or straight funky. Of course traditional flavor-supporters like wasabi, soy sauce, pickled ginger and kombu are present. If I remember correctly, the course cost about 10,000 yen.

**Restaurant** <u>Tsujihan</u>\
**Location**📍Arkhills\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={89} />
**Notes** - Way before TikTok craze, this place got my stamp of approval back in January. At that point, I rated it in the high 90s, since it was an unassuming lunch spot serving a humble 1,250 yen dish that brought you extreme happiness as you left the restaurant chewing on a toothpick. I went twice in two weeks, consistently amazing the second time, which is a true sign of a top-notch eatery. Come March, after it exploded in the "I saw this on tiktok we HAVE TO GO" digital world of virality, I went again to find the lines to be irresponsibly long and the prices marked up 36%. These unwelcomed changes very well may have contributed to the bias, but in the end, the flavor, which I regard highest in importance, was also compromised.

**Restaurant** <u>Etsubo</u>\
**Location**📍Arkhills - South Tower\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={93} />
**Notes** - The orchestration of the staff at this upper-scale after-work izakaya is remarkable. They have an open kitchen layout where you can see the kitchen stations from the bar. There are three stations in a fairly tight space and, with about two persons per station, the space looks even tigher. Watching them put out dishes for a packed happy hour crowd was super impressive. Looked like some kind of a well run sports team or a groovin' jazz ensemble. From the frying station to the charcoal grill yakitori corner to the sashimi/raw bar, the place hums so smoothly that they should be studied by other restuaranteurs. They use a menu system where you order from a website accessible by QR code, and all the servers walk around with nothing but repurposed iPod Touches with higher level privileges to fix orders and check on other things.

**Restaurant** <u>Tenfuku</u>\
**Location**📍Oomorikita\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={80} />
**Notes** - For this 15+ course meal, you sit directly at the bar and are presented with dishes that are mostly fried in lightly coated tempura breading. Highlight is the last dish, the tendon, which is vegetable and seafood tempura over a bed of rice with light soy sauce. I think they mentioned that the bento version of this item is a big hit.

**Restaurant** <u>양평해장국</u>\
**Location**📍Ookubo\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={77} />
**Notes** - Solid 순댓국. Clean and good flavor but nothing stands out. If you have a Korean food fix in Tokyo, this is the place to go.

**Restaurant** <u>Kara-age Senmon Kimisei</u>\
**Location**📍Roppongi\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={80} />
**Notes** - I would eat here very frequently for lunch if I worked in the area. Four large chunks of dark meat kara-age chicken with unlimited rice and cabbage salad. Would be nice if the breading was a little lighter. Large portions!

**Restaurant** <u>세광양대창</u>\
**Location**📍일산\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={95} />
**Notes** - Highest rating of the trip! It is hard to go wrong with 대창 from 한우 marinated in lightly sweet and spicy sauce cooked over a charcoal grill; however, without proper ventilation, the smoke levels can get disastrous. This is where this place shines because it has these cool looking vents that come up from the tables and sit directly above the grill sucking up all the smoke expelled from the rendering down of the fat clumps on the meat. Friendly staff explains the cooking process and will insist on doing the grilling themselves since cooking 대창 is not as simple as cooking typical K-bbq. The cleanliness is impressive, considering this place cooks the greasiest part of the cow right from the tables.

**Restaurant** <u>Congee GoGo</u>\
**Location**📍일산\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={80} />
**Notes** - They had a fire at this location a couple months prior and re-opened when I was visiting the town. Old favorite, tastes just as good if not even better than the last time. Apparently coming back from a fire in the restaurant-world is some kind of good luck in Korea. Korean superstitions never ceases to amaze me.

**Restaurant** <u>Sarutahiko Coffee</u>\
**Location**📍Shimokitazawa\
**Rating** 
<ProgressBar valuePercentage={90} />
**Notes** - Bonus coffee rating. Got a regular latte that was the perfect blend of smooth and strong. A franchised coffee shop with multiple locations where people come to work, read and chat. A thousand times better than starbucks, dunkin or pete's.

Annnnnd there you have it. I would like to mention that my stomach was growling the entire time I was writing this, and I hope people will appreciate the pain and suffering I had to endure to get this out there. Finally, a funny piece of observation, which is that, in Japan, one of the premium brands of water is from Fuji, where in the states we have Fiji. Riddle me that.
