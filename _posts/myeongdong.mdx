(Written on Jan 27, 2024) What do we Millenials love? Walking into local coffee shops, which is what I did yesterday morning in Myeongdong. Little did I know that an innocent <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="pic2">scone</LightboxLink> would completely shake up everything I've come to know about scones. Up until this day, my loose definition of a scone was a pastry with dry crumbly texture, almost biscuit-like, but everthing changed when I took a bite of this scone. It was moist yet kept together sturdily like a right-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookie that's cooled for about thirty minutes. It was paired with an <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="pic1">earl grey milk tea</LightboxLink> that was so warm and delicious that it momentarily put an end to my coffee cravings, which I've been dealing with since I had quit coffee at the turn of the new year. I can proudly say that my Millenial senses did not fail me when I stumbled into [카페느티](https://kko.to/9ioSq7JPd1) on this cold morning. Starting my day there would be a sign of more good things follow because what proceeded it was an on-point lunch meal at [슈슈차이](https://kko.to/0zFo7EZxEi), a Koreo-Chinese restaurant inside of a department store food hall. In an effort to maintain low gluten intake, I opted out of the 자장면 and in for the <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="pic3">자장밥</LightboxLink>. I couldn't believe it when I took the first <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="pic5">spoonful</LightboxLink> of rice after lightly tossing in the black sauce because I had just tasted a flavor that I did not know existed. It could only be described as black magic or, more coloquially, top-shelf MSG. My mother had <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="pic4">짬뽕</LightboxLink> which I've always regarded as a supporting character to the 자장 and hardly a dish that can stand on its own, but I have to admit the bits of squid in it were almost as soft as scallop. On a different day, lunch was to be enjoyed at the world famous [명동교자](https://kko.to/kCqtkOgjdQ) on a Friday afternoon when the lines were suprisingly only a few tables long. Similar to Kat'z Deli in NYC's houston st, this place ran on organized chaos, a common phenomenon when an old restaurant meets popularity. The restaurant had been around since my parents childhood days serving the same dishes that people love today. When a table opened up, we were directed through a maze of tables to our seats, and as good korean customers that we are, we gave the usher our order as we lowered our butts to our seats, and in a matter of minutes, maybe seconds, we were served with steaming hot <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="noodles1">칼국수</LightboxLink>, <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="bibim">비빔면</LightboxLink>, <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="dumpling1">만두</LightboxLink> (cover photo), and a <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="kimchi">bucket of kimchi</LightboxLink>. The noodles were delicious, soft and chewy, just like the skin of the dumplings, which were perfect in temperature and density, making it easy to eat in one bite. <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="dumpling2">It</LightboxLink> was like a scene out of Kungfu Panda. From there we left the restaurant and got a cup of <LightboxLink data={pix} picId="dabang">sweet cream coffee</LightboxLink> at a cafe that my parents used to actually hang out at called [Gamoo Cafe](https://kko.to/5ptMu2DCpp). Everyone there was people of my parents generation indulging in nostalgia.
